# [Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js)-softening
Harden Firefox, but not so much. Keep tabs, allow WebRTC (Video Calls, Audio and Video streaming), save history for a few days, enable cachig for speed and maybe more.

I use this personally to make [Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) usable. It works with the Addon SimpleTabGroups, Jitsi/BBB Video-calls and more. 

Firefox settings change a lot, for example the recent change from

`user_pref("browser.startup.page", 3);`to  `user_pref("browser.startup.homepage", 3);`


This makes updating always time-consuming so I am happy for help on this project! Just fork it and create a pull request for new versions if you like.
